# Data Cleaning

The code demonstrates various data cleaning techniques applied to a dataset containing diabetes data. The goal of the code is to preprocess the dataset, handle missing values, identify outliers, and improve the overall data quality.

## Dependencies

The following dependencies are required to run the code:

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn
- matplotlib

## Code Overview

The data cleaning code performs the following operations:

1. Removing duplicate records from the dataset.
2. Detecting and dropping columns with low information.
3. Handling missing values by replacing them with appropriate strategies.
4. Visualizing missing values using heatmaps.
5. Removing rows with a high number of missing values.
6. Identifying outliers using interquartile range (IQR) and z-score methods.
7. Visualizing outliers and clean data records.
